# MedFlow 

## Overview

MedFlow is a Power BI dashboard designed to optimize healthcare efficiency by providing real-time tracking and in-depth analysis of patient waiting lists. The dashboard utilizes data transformation, modeling, and visualization techniques to offer insights into waiting list trends, specialties, and age profiles.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in MedFlow encompasses publicly available healthcare data related to patient waiting lists. It comprises two primary categories: inpatient and outpatient. In the context of this analysis, an inpatient is a patient admitted for treatment, while an outpatient undergoes treatment on the same day without hospital admission.

## Features

- **Data Transformation:** The dashboard employs data transformation techniques to ensure accurate representation of healthcare data, including inpatient and outpatient categories.

- **Modeling:** The data is modeled for effective analysis, with relationships established between key tables. A specialty mapping table is utilized to categorize specialties for better visualization.
